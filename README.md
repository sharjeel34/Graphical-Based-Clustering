#Introduction
Graphical-based clustering is a type of clustering analysis that utilizes graphical 
representations of data to identify natural groupings or clusters within a dataset.
This approach involves plotting the data points in a two- or three-dimensional space
based on their attributes and then using visual cues to identify groups of points that 
are similar to one another. The goal is to identify clusters that have high within-
group similarity and low between-group similarity.

There are several types of graphical-based clustering techniques, including k-means 
clustering, hierarchical clustering, and self-organizing maps. K-means clustering is
a popular approach that involves iteratively partitioning the data into k clusters 
based on their distance from a randomly selected set of cluster centers. Hierarchical 
clustering involves creating a tree-like structure to represent the relationships between
clusters, with the most similar clusters grouped together at the bottom of the tree. 
Self-organizing maps use a neural network approach to create a low-dimensional
representation of the data that preserves the topological relationships between the data points.

Graphical-based clustering can be a useful tool for exploratory data analysis, 
as it allows analysts to identify natural groupings within the data that may not 
be apparent through other methods. It is often used in fields such as marketing, 
biology, and image analysis, among others.
